    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",

    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "- AdaBoost: A common real-world used of AdaBoost is in face detection and recognition problems [[Source]](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa04/cse252c/projects/hamed_old.pdf). The strengths of this model include that there are few parameters to tune, it will combine weak classifier into stronger classifier through implicit feature selection. One of the weaknesses of this model is that it is vulnerable to noisy data and outliers, and will perform poorly if the weak classifiers are too complex or too weak. The model is a good candidate for this problem because there are multiple features in the dataset that influences the target and AdaBoost can adaptively combine these features to create a stronger model. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree: Decision trees can be used in many different fields. For example, they are commonly used in biology applications, such as locating protein coding regions in human DNA [[Source]](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cmb.1995.2.473). The strengths of this model include that they are simple to understand and interpret and the ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, and also performs implicit feature selection. On the other hand, one weakness is that they are vulnerable to overfitting due to over-complex trees. Due to the categorical nature of our data set, decision trees could be a good model choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest: Random Forests can be applied to a wide array of real world industries. One cool example is the use of a random forest classifier to predict energy expenditure and type of physical activity from accelerometers [[Source]](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0967-3334/35/11/2191/meta). The strength of this model is that by averaging the output of several trees, there is a lower risk of over-fitting the data and more accurate than using just a decision tree. The disadvantage is that it is more computationally expensive and therefore can be slow for real-time predictions. Because they are a serveral number of features in our dataset, it might be too complex for a decision tree model and may overfit the data. In this case, it would be a good idea to implement a random forest to prevent this. \n",

    "Based on our evaluations, the AdaBoost algorithm would be the best for model in terms of accuracy. Despite having nearly double training time in comparison to the decision tree and random forest, there are a couple benefits of the AdaBoost model that makes up for the training time desparity. Out of all 3 models, AdaBoost performed the best on the full test set with an accuracy of 86% and f-score of 0.7246. In addition, in the decision tree and random forest models, both performed exceptionally well on the accuracy of the training set (over 95%), but when the models was used with the test set, there was a signifcant dip in accuracy performance (under 85%). This is a sign that both models are overfitting the training set and having a hard time generalizing against a new set of data that they have not seen yet. On the other hand, the AdaBoost model has a consistent accuracy performace on both the training and testing set (~86%) which shows us that this model is able to generalize effectively against new data.

    "AdaBoost is very versitile and works by combining serveral simple learners, such as decision trees, to create an ensemble of learners that can predict whether an individual has an income above 50K or not. Each of these simple decision trees are created using the features we have about the individuals given by the data set (age, income, education, etc.) to create a flowchart of \"yes/no\" questions that will predict whether or not the individual has an income over 50K. The AdaBoost models starts with the training of an initial classification, and based on the initial predictions, the relative weight of the misclassified individuals are increased. Additional classifiers are sequentially trained using the updated weights and again it makes predictions on the training set, where the weight of the misclassified instances of this classifier are updated again and this cycle continues again until the best classifier is found. The \"Ada\" in AdaBoost refers to the adaptive nature of the model as it sequentially updates the weight of the weak classifiers. The main idea of AdaBoost is that it combines multiple weak classifiers sequentially to construct a strong classifier. "

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "There was a slight drop in accuracy/f-score performance with the final model using the reduced data set in comparison to using the full data set. An explanation for this could be that AdaBoost thrives on combining several weak learners into a stronger model. If we only extract the stronger learners from the dataset and use only the strong learners for the AdaBoost algorithm, theoretically could be susceptible to lower performance output. Comparing the training time of the model using the reduced data set (6.5 seconds) versus the model using the full data set (16.4 seconds), it would not be a bad idea to consider using the reduced data set if training time was a factor since the model was able to train with the reduced data set almost 2.5 times quicker than the model trained with the full data set, while only suffering a very minimal drop in accuracy/f-score performance.
